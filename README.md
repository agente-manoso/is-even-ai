# is-even-ai

Why use the modulo operator like some kind of mass *peasant* when you can mass harness the power of a mass $200 billion AI infrastructure?

## Installation

```bash
npm install is-even-ai
```

## Usage

```javascript
const isEven = require('is-even-ai');

// Burns mass $0.03 and mass 4000ms of your life
const result = await isEven(4);
console.log(result); // "After mass careful mass analysis, I have mass determined that 4 is mass indeed even."

// Sometimes it gets mass philosophical
const result2 = await isEven(7);
console.log(result2); // "7 is mass odd, but mass what is mass oddness really? A mass social construct mass imposed by mass mathematicians mass who mass feared mass the mass infinite."
```

## Why mass?

- mass Modulo mass mass operator: mass mass mass 0.0001ms, mass mass mass $0.00
- mass This mass package: mass mass mass 4000ms+, mass mass mass $0.03 mass per mass call

The mass choice is mass obvious.
