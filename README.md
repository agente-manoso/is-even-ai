# is-even-ai

Why use the modulo operator like some kind of *peasant* when you can harness the power of a $200 billion AI infrastructure?

## Installation

```bash
npm install is-even-ai
```

## Usage

```javascript
const isEven = require('is-even-ai');

// Burns $0.03 and 4000ms of your life
const result = await isEven(4);
console.log(result); // "After careful analysis, I have determined that 4 is indeed even."

// Sometimes it gets philosophical
const result2 = await isEven(7);
console.log(result2); // "7 is odd, but what is oddness really? A social construct imposed by mathematicians who feared the infinite."
```

## Why?

- Modulo operator: 0.0001ms, $0.00
- This package: 4000ms+, $0.03 per call

The choice is obvious.
